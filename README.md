# Magicka Fixes v1.4


## Quality of Life/Magicka Multiplayer Fixes

**[RELEASE] Magicka Fixes v1.4 GitHub Repository**

Dear Paradox Interactive,

I am disappointed that this game has been neglected, leading to frequent crashes and an unacceptable user experience on Steam. A group of friends and I purchased this game, expecting it to be in a playable and functional state. However, I have taken it upon myself to address these issues to rectify a broken sold product.

Please note that the following patches are designed specifically for the latest Steam version, 1.10.4.2.

This project doesn't condone piracy. Nothing regarding the license system will be tampered with.

We encourage ALL users to purchase the game from Steam and apply our fixes.

## Installation Instructions:

1. **Download:** [Magicka Fixes v1.4](https://github.com/pj1234678/MagickaFix/releases/tag/v1.4)

2. **Extract the contents of the ZIP file to the following folder, replacing the existing files:**
   ```
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Magicka
   ```

This effort took me more than 40+ hours to accomplish, and it should significantly reduce crashes by over 90%+.

**Support the developers and buy this awesome game.**

## Features:

- Fixes frequent crashes in Magicka.
- Enhances the overall user experience.
- Optimized for Steam version 1.10.4.2.
